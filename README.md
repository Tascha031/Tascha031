- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tascha031
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, dungeons & dragons and building websides.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a front-end engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on trading knowledge, learning and improving skills.
- 📫 How to reach me ... through my account I guess, just know that I'm pretty shy.
- 🌍 English isn't my first language, so I'm also learning to improve on my English writing.
- ☎️ Fun fact: 031 is the phone number of The Netherlands, where I'm from.
